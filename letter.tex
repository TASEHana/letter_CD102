 This Letter reports on the first results from the 
Taiwan Axion Search Experiment with Haloscope, a search for axions 
using a microwave cavity at frequencies between \flo\ and \fhi~GHz. 
Apart from the non-axion signals, no candidates with 
a significance more than 3.355 were found. The experiment excludes 
models with the axion-two-photon coupling $\gagg\gtrsim \avelimit\GeVinv$, 
a factor of eleven above the benchmark 
KSVZ model in the mass range $\mlo < \ma < \mhi \muevcc$, reaching 
a sensitivity three orders of magnitude better than any existing limits. 
 It is also the first time that a haloscope-type experiment places 
constraints on the \bgagg\ in this mass region.

%%% Introduction} 
Various astrophysical and cosmological observations indicate that dark matter 
(DM) exists and makes up 26.4\% of the total energy density of the 
universe~\cite{DMI,DMII,DMIII,DMIV,PDG}. One of the viable dark matter 
candidates is the axion, which arises from the spontaneous breaking of a new 
global U(1)$_\mathrm{PQ}$ symmetry~\cite{strongCPI}  
introduced by Peccei and Quinn to solve the strong CP 
problem~\cite{strongCPI,strongCPII,strongCPIII}. 
Axions are abundantly produced during the QCD phase transition in 
the early universe and may constitute the 
DM~\cite{ADDONI,ADDONII,ADDONIII,ADDONIV}. 
In the post-inflationary PQ symmetry breaking scenario, 
%where the PQ symmetry is broken after inflation, 
current calculations suggest a mass range of 
${\cal O}(1â€“100)$~\muevcc\ for axions so that the cosmic axion density does 
not exceed the 
observed cold DM density~\cite{QCDCalI,QCDCalII,QCDCalIII,QCDCalIV,QCDCalV,QCDCalVI,QCDCalVII,QCDCalVIII,QCDCalIX,QCDCalX,QCDCalXI,QCDCalXII,QCDCalXIII}. 
%Therefore, axions are compelling because they may explain at the same 
%time two puzzles that are on scales different by more than thirty orders of 
%magnitude. 
%

Axions could be detected and studied via their two-photon interaction, the
so-called ``inverse Primakoff effect'', of which the strength 
is described by the coupling constant \bgagg. 
The detectors with the best sensitivities to axions with a mass of 
$\ma\approx \muevcc$, as first proposed by 
Sikivie~\cite{SikivieI,SikivieII},  
are haloscopes consisting of a microwave (MW) cavity immersed in a strong static 
magnetic field and operated at a cryogenic temperature. 
In the presence of an external magnetic field, the ambient oscillating axion 
field drives the cavity and they resonate when the frequencies of the 
electromagnetic 
modes in the cavity match the MW frequency $f$, where $f$ is set by 
the total energy of the axion: $hf=E_a=\ma c^2 + \frac{1}{2}\ma v^2$. The 
axion signal power is further delivered 
to the readout probe followed by a low-noise linear amplifier. 
%The axion mass is unknown, therefore, 
%the cavity resonator must allow the possibility to be tuned through a range
%of possible axion masses. 

Several haloscope experiments have actively carried out axion searches, and 
the limits on the \bgagg\ from a few of them have 
reached or approached the benchmark values. The most significant efforts 
are from the Axion Dark Matter 
eXperiment (ADMX), placing tight constraints within the mass range of 
1.9--4.2\muevcc~\cite{ADMXI,ADMXII,ADMXIII,ADMXIV,ADMXV,ADMXVI,ADMXVII}. 
Others include the Haloscope at Yale Sensitive to Axion Cold dark matter 
(HAYSTAC)~\cite{HAYSTACIII,HAYSTACIV,HAYSTACI}, the Center 
for Axion and Precision Physics Research (CAPP)~\cite{CAPPII,CAPPIII,CAPPI}, 
and the QUest for AXions-$a\gamma$ (QUAX-$a\gamma$)~\cite{QUAX}. 
%
This Letter presents the first results 
of a search for axions in the mass range of \mlo--\mhi\muevcc, 
from the Taiwan Axion Search Experiment with Haloscope (TASEH). 

%% Experimental Setup 
The detector of TASEH is located at the Department of Physics, National 
Central University, Taiwan and housed within a cryogen-free 
dilution refrigerator (DR) from BlueFors. An 8-Tesla 
superconducting solenoid with a 
bore diameter of 76~mm and a length of 240 mm is integrated with the DR.  
The DR has multiple flanges at different temperatures: 50K, 4K, still, 
and mixing flanges, among which the mixing flange could reach the lowest 
temperature at $T_{\rm mx}\simeq27$~mK. 
%
During the data taking, the cavity sat in the center of the magnet bore 
and was connected via holders to the mixing flange of the DR. %at a 
%temperature of $T_{\rm mx}\simeq27$~mK. 
%The temperature of the cavity stayed at $T_\text{c}\simeq155$~mK, higher 
%with respect to the mixing flange; it is believed that the cavity had an 
%unexpected thermal contact with the radiation shield in the DR. 
The $0.234$-L cavity, 
made of oxygen-free high-conductivity (OFHC) copper, 
 is a two-cell cylinder split along 
the axial direction, with an inner radius of 2.5~cm and a 
height of 12~cm. In order to maintain a smooth surface, the cavity underwent 
the processes of annealing, polishing, and chemical cleaning. 
The resonant frequency can be tuned via the rotation of an off-axis OFHC 
copper tuning rod. 
%
A readout probe, made of a 50-$\Omega$ semi-rigid coaxial cable that was 
soldered to an SMA (SubMiniature version A) connector, was inserted into the 
cavity.  
An additional weak-coupling probe, made of a standard SMA 
product, was used to inject MW signals for examining the cavity 
characteristics and for testing the signal receivers.  
The signal from the readout probe was directed to an 
impedance-matched amplification chain. The first-stage amplifier was 
a low noise high-electron-mobility transistor (HEMT) amplifier 
mounted on the 4K flange. A three-stage circulator was anchored at 
the mixing flange to prevent thermal radiation from the HEMT 
amplifier back streaming to the cold cavity and then being reflected. 
The signal was further amplified at room temperature via a 
three-stage post-amplifier, and down-converted 
and demodulated to in-phase (I) and quadrature (Q) components and digitized 
by an analog-to-digital converter with a sampling rate of 2~MHz. 
%Via a cryogenic microwave switch, the output line can also be connected 
%to a blackbody radiation source, made of a 50-$\Omega$ terminator, for 
%calibration. 
Figure~\ref{fig:TASEH} shows a simplified diagram for the TASEH apparatus. 
%which was used to examine the cavity characteristics, to perform the 
%calibration of the amplification chain, and to carry out the axion 
%detection experiment. 
More details of the TASEH detector can be found 
in Ref.~\cite{TASEHInstrumentation}.

 Via the cryogenic switch, the output line can also be connected                                                                                             
 to a blackbody radiation source, made of a 50-$\Omega$ terminator, 
 for calibration of the amplification chain. 
 The two input lines, used to inject MW signals, have one attenuator 
 thermally anchored at each cold flange to reduce the broadband 
 radiation from the higher-temperature environment or flanges.

%\subsection{The expected axion signal power and signal line shape}
%\label{sec:introsignal}

The signal power extracted from a MW cavity on resonance is given 
by~\cite{AxionFormula,HAYSTACIII}:
\begin{equation}
P_s = \left(\bggamma^2\frac{\alpha^2\hbar^3c^3\rho_a}{\pi^2\Lambda^4}\right)\times
\left(\omega_c\frac{1}{\mu_0}B_0^2VCQ_L\frac{\beta}{1+\beta}\right).
\label{eq:ps}
\end{equation}
The first set of parentheses contains physical constants, 
a dimensionless model-dependent parameter \bggamma, and 
the local dark-matter density 
$\rho_a=0.45~\GeV/\mathrm{cm}^3$~\cite{[{}][{. Both $0.45~\GeV/\mathrm{cm}^3$ 
(used by ADMX, HAYSTAC, CAPP, and QUAX-$a\gamma$) and $0.3~\GeV/\mathrm{cm}^3$ 
(more commonly cited by the other direct DM search experiments) are consistent 
with the recent measurements.}]Read:2014qva,PDG}. 
The numerical values of \bggamma\ are -0.97 and 0.36 
in the Kim-Shifman-Vainshtein-Zakharov (KSVZ)~\cite{KSVZI,KSVZII} and 
the Dine-Fischler-Srednicki-Zhitnitsky (DFSZ)~\cite{DFSZI,DFSZII} benchmark 
models, respectively. For the QCD axions, the \bgagg\ 
is related to \bggamma\ and the axion mass \ma: 
\begin{equation}
 \bgagg = \left(\frac{\bggamma\alpha}{\pi \Lambda^2}\right)\ma, 
\label{eq:grelation}
\end{equation}
where $\alpha$ is the 
fine-structure constant and  $\Lambda=78~\MeV$ is a scale parameter that can 
be derived from the mass and the decay constant of the pion and the ratio of 
the up to down quark masses. 
%
The second set of parentheses contains parameters related to the experimental 
setup: the angular resonant frequency of the cavity $\omega_c$, 
the vacuum permeability $\mu_0$, the nominal strength of the external magnetic 
field $B_0$, the effective volume of the cavity $V$, and the loaded quality factor of 
the cavity \(Q_L=Q_0/(1+\beta)\), where $Q_0$ is the unloaded, intrinsic 
quality factor and $\beta$ is the coupling coefficient which 
determines the amount 
of coupling of the signal to the receiver. The form factor $C$ is the 
normalized overlap of the electric field 
$\vec{\bm{E}}$, for a particular cavity resonant mode, with the external 
magnetic field $\vec{\bm{B}}$:
\begin{equation}
  C = \frac{\left[\int\left( \vec{\bm{B}}\cdot\vec{\bm{E}}\right) d^3\bm{x}\right]^2}{B_0^2V\int E^2 d^3\bm{x}}.
\label{eq:formfactor} 
\end{equation} 
The magnetic field $\vec{\bm{B}}$ in TASEH points mostly along the axial
direction of the cavity, with a small variation of
field strength along the radial and axial directions. 
For cylindrical cavities, the largest form factor is from the 
TM$_{010}$ mode. The expected signal power derived from the experimental 
parameters of TASEH is $P_s\simeq 1.4\times10^{-24}$~W for a KSVZ axion 
with a mass of 19.5\muevcc. 

In the axion experiments, the figure of merit that determines the design of 
the experimental setup is the signal-to-noise ratio
(SNR), i.e. the ratio of the signal power $P_s$ to the fluctuation in 
the averaged noise power spectrum $\sigma_n$. 
According to Dicke's Radiometer Equation~\cite{Dicke}, the $\sigma_n$ 
is given by: 
\begin{equation}
 \sigma_n  =  k_B\tsys\sqrt{\frac{\Delta f}{t}} 
 \label{eq:sigman}
\end{equation}
where \tsys\ is the system noise temperature, an effective 
temperature associated with the total noise of the system, 
$t$ is the data integration time $t$ 
and $\Delta f$ is the resolution bandwidth. 
Assuming that all the axion signal power falls within $\Delta f$, 
the SNR will therefore be:
\begin{equation}
   \text{SNR}  =  \frac{P_s}{\sigma_n}=  \frac{P_s}{k_B\tsys}\sqrt{\frac{t}{\Delta f}}.
 \label{eq:SNR}
\end{equation}  
%One could see that the SNR is maximized by an experimental setup with 
%a strong magnetic field, a large cavity volume, an efficient cavity 
%resonant mode, a receiver with low system noise temperature, and a 
%long integration time. 


The system noise temperature \tsys\ has three major components:
\begin{equation}
 \tsys = \Tilde{T}_\text{mx} + \left(\Tilde{T}_\text{c}-\Tilde{T}_\text{mx}\right)L(\omega) + \ta,
\label{eq:pn}
\end{equation}
where $\omega$ is the angular frequency.
The last term \ta\ is the effective temperature of the
noise added by the receiver (mainly from the first-stage amplifier).
The sum of the first two terms is equivalent 
to the sum of the reflection of the incoming noise from
the attenuator anchored to the mixing flange  
and the transmission of the noise from the cavity body itself.
The
$\Tilde{T}_i=\left(\frac{1}{e^{\left.\hbar\omega\middle/k_BT_i\right.}-1} + \frac{1}{2}\right)\left. \hbar\omega\middle/k_B\right.$ refers to
the effective temperature due to
the blackbody radiation at a physical temperature $T_i$ and
the vacuum fluctuation.
%The $T_\text{c}\simeq155$~mK and $T_\text{mx}\simeq27$~mK are the physical
%temperatures of the cavity and of the mixing flange, respectively. 
The difference
of the effective temperatures $\Tilde{T}_\text{c}-\Tilde{T}_\text{mx}$ is
modulated by a Lorentzian function $L(\omega)$. 
If the physical temperature of the cavity $T_\text{c}$ and $T_\text{mx}$ 
were identical, the thermal noise spectrum from the cavity would be white. 
The derivation of the first two terms in Eq.~\eqref{eq:pn} can be found in
Ref.~\cite{TASEHAnalysis}. 
%
%
%Using the operation parameters of TASEH and 
%the results from the calibration of readout electronics, 
%the values of $T_\text{b}$, $T_\text{qn}$, and \ta\ are estimated to be about 
%0.07~K, 0.12~K, and \noise~K, respectively.  
%Therefore, 
The \ta\ obtained from the calibration via the blackbody radiation source 
in Fig.~\ref{fig:TASEH} is about \noise~K and  
the baseline value of \tsys\ is about 2.0--2.3~K. 


The data for the analysis presented here were collected by TASEH 
from October 13, 2021 to November 15, 2021, and are termed as the CD102 data, 
where CD stands for ``cool down''. 
The CD102 data cover the frequency range of \flo--\fhi~GHz. In this Letter, 
most of the frequencies in unit of GHz are quoted with five decimal places as the 
absolute accuracy of frequency is $\approx 10$~kHz. It shall be noted that the 
frequency resolution is 1~kHz.  
During the CD102 data run, 
the temperature of the cavity stayed at $T_\text{c}\simeq155$~mK, higher 
with respect to the mixing flange; it is believed that the cavity had an 
unexpected thermal contact with the radiation shield in the DR. 
The form factor $C$ for 
the TM$_{010}$ mode varies from 0.60 to 0.61 over the operational 
frequency range. 
The $Q_0$ at the cryogenic temperature 
($T_\mathrm{c}\simeq 155$~mK) is $\simeq 60700$. 
There were 837 resonant-frequency steps in total, with a frequency difference 
of $\Delta f_\text{s}=95-115$~kHz between the steps. The value of 
$\Delta f_\text{s}$ was kept within 10\% of 105~kHz rather than 
a fixed value, such that the rotation angle of the tuning rod did not need to 
be fine-tuned and the operation time could be minimized; a 10\% variation of 
the $\Delta f_\text{s}$ is found to have no impact on the \gagg\ limits. 
Each resonant-frequency step is denoted as a ``scan'' 
and the data integration time was about 32-42 minutes. The integration 
time was determined based on the target \gagg\ limits and the experimental 
parameters; the variation of the integration 
time aimed to remove the frequency-dependence in the \gagg\ limits caused by   
frequency dependence of the added noise \ta. 
The depth of the readout probe was set for 
$\beta\simeq2$ since this value maximizes the scan rate, namely the coverage 
of frequency scans for a given amount of time. 

%In order to perform a calibration for the amplification chain, 
%the HEMT was connected to a heat source (a 50-$\Omega$ resistor) instead of
%the cavity;
%various values of input currents were sent to the source to change its
%temperature monitored by a thermometer. The power from the source
%was delivered following the same transmission line as that in the axion
%data running. 
%The output power is fitted to a first-order polynomial, as a function of
%the source temperature, to extract the gain and added noise \ta\ for the
%amplification chain. The value of \ta\ is about \noise~K. 
%



%%% analysis and results

   The analysis of the TASEH CD102 data follows the procedure similar to that 
developed by the HAYSTAC experiment~\cite{HAYSTACII} and the details are 
described in Ref.~\cite{TASEHAnalysis}. The fast Fourier transform (FFT) 
algorithm is performed on the IQ time series data to obtain the 
frequency-domain power spectrum. 
%Apart from the flat baseline as described by
%Eq.~\eqref{eq:pn}, the noise spectrum observed by TASEH has an additional
%component with a Lorentzian shape due to the higher temperature at the
%cavity with respect to that in the DR. 
The Savitzky-Golay (SG) 
filter~\cite{SGFilter} is applied to remove the Lorentzian structure of 
the background caused by the temperature difference between the cavity and 
the mixing flange [Eq.~\eqref{eq:pn}]. All the spectra from different 
frequency scans, particularly for the frequency bins that appear in 
multiple spectra, are combined with a weighting algorithm. 
The uncertainty of the averaged power at the overlapped region is
reduced due to the combination. 
In order to maximize the SNR, a running window of 
five consecutive bins in the combined spectrum is applied and the five bins 
within each window are merged to construct a final spectrum. 
The five frequency bins correspond to the 5-kHz axion signal line width,  
derived from the standard assumption of axion signal line shape as described 
by Eq.~\eqref{eq:simplesignal}. 
This signal line shape is also used when defining the maximum likelihood 
weights for merging: 
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{F}(f, f_a) = \frac{2}{\sqrt{\pi}}\sqrt{f-f_a}\left(\frac{3}{\alpha}\right)^{3/2}
e^{\frac{-3\left(f-f_a\right)}{\alpha}},
\label{eq:simplesignal}
\end{equation}
where $\alpha\equiv  f_a \left<v^2\right>/c^2$. 
Here, the frequency $f$ must be greater or equal to the axion frequency 
$f_a=\left.\ma c^2\middle/h\right.$. 
In this standard assumption of axion signal line shape, 
the DM halo density distribution is assumed 
to be spherically symmetric and close to be isothermal, which results in a 
velocity distribution similar to the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution. 
Therefore, the variance $\left<v^2\right>$ and the most probable velocity
(speed) $v_p$ are related to each other:
$\left<v^2\right>=3v_p^2/2=$(270~km/s)$^2$, where $v_p=220$~km/s is the local
circular velocity of DM in the galactic rest frame and this value is also
used by other axion experiments.



 After the merging, if there were any potential signal with an SNR larger than 
3.355, a rescan would be proceeded to check if it were a real signal 
or a statistical fluctuation. 
The procedure of the CD102 data taking was to perform a rescan after 
covering every 10~MHz; the rescan was done by adjusting the tuning rod of the 
cavity so to match the resonant frequency to the frequency of the candidate. 
In total, 22 candidates with an SNR greater than 3.355 were found. 
Among them, 10 candidates were from the fluctuations because they were gone 
after a few rescans. 
The remaining two candidates, in the frequency ranges of 
4.71017 -- 4.71019~GHz and 4.74730 -- 4.74738~GHz, are excluded from 
consideration of axion signal candidates. The signal in the second frequency 
range was detected via a portable antenna outside the DR and found 
to come from the instrument control computer in the laboratory, while the 
signal in the first frequency range was not 
detected outside the DR but still present after 
turning off the external magnetic field. 
Therefore, no limits are placed for the above two frequency ranges.  

%% results
Since no candidates were found after the rescan, the upper limits 
at 95\% confidence level (C.L.) on the \ggamma\ and the 
 \gagg\ are derived by setting the maximum SNR equal to five.  
Figure~\ref{fig:gaggall} shows the limits on the \gagg\ from TASEH and the 
ratio of the limits on the \ggamma\ 
with respect to the KSVZ benchmark value ($\left|g_\text{KSVZ}\right|=0.97$) 
from TASEH together with those from the previous searches. 
The limits on 
\gagg\ range from \lolimit\GeVinv\ to \hilimit\GeVinv, with an average 
value of \avelimit\GeVinv; the lowest value comes from the frequency bins with 
additional eight times more data from the rescans, while the highest value 
comes from the frequency bins near the boundaries of the spectrum. 
%The results of TASEH exclude the models with the axion-two-photon 
%coupling $\gagg\gtrsim \avelimit\GeVinv$, a factor of eleven above the 
%benchmark 
%KSVZ model for the mass range $\mlo < \ma < \mhi \muevcc$ (corresponding to 
%the frequency range of $\flo < f_a < \fhi$~GHz). 
%
The analysis that merges bins without 
assuming a signal line shape results in $\approx5.5$\% larger values on the 
\gagg\ limits. If a Gaussian signal line shape with an FWHM of 2.5~kHz,  
about half of the axion line width in Eq.~\eqref{eq:simplesignal}, is 
assumed instead, the limits will be $\approx3.8$\% smaller than the central 
results. If the \gagg\ limits are derived from the observed SNR as described 
in the ADMX paper~\cite{ADMXVIII},
rather than using the 5$\sigma$ target SNR, the average limit on \gagg\ will
be $\approx\ADMXavelimit\GeVinv$. 
%
Overall the total relative systematic uncertainty is 
$\approx 4.6\%$, coming from the uncertainties on the loaded quality 
factor $Q_L$, the coupling coefficient $\beta$, the added noise temperature 
\ta, the effect of the misalignment between the true axion frequency and 
the lower boundaries of the frequency bins, and the variation of the 
SG-filter parameters.

the synthetic axion signals were injected into the cavity and read out via the 
same transmission line and amplification chain. 
%Due to the uncertainties on the losses of signal transmission
% lines, the synthetic axion signals are not used to perform an absolute 
%calibration of the search sensitivity. Instead, 
%a test with synthetic axion signals could be used to verify the procedures of 
%data acquisition and physics analysis. 
The procedure to generate axion-like signals is summarized in 
Ref.~\cite{TASEHInstrumentation} and the analysis of the synthetic axion 
data is described in Ref.~\cite{TASEHAnalysis}. 
The analysis results of the synthetic axion signals demonstrates
the capability of the experimental setup and the analysis strategy to discover
an axion signal with 
$\ggamma\approx {\cal O}\left(10\left|g_\text{KSVZ}\right|\right)$.


%% conclusion 
This Letter presents the first results of a search for axions for the mass 
range $\mlo < \ma < \mhi \muevcc$. 
Apart from the non-axion signals, no candidates with a significance more than
3.355 were found. The experiment excludes models with the 
axion-two-photon coupling $\gagg\gtrsim \avelimit\GeVinv$ at 95\% C.L.,
 a factor of eleven 
above the benchmark KSVZ model. The sensitivity on \gagg\ reached by TASEH 
is three orders of magnitude better than the existing limits. 
It is also the first time that a haloscope-type experiment places 
constraints in this mass region. 

%The target of TASEH is to search for axions for the mass range of 
%16.5--20.7\muevcc\ corresponding to a frequency range of 4--5~GHz, with a 
%capability to be extended to 2.5--6~GHz in the future. 
%In the coming years, several upgrades are expected, including: the use of a 
%quantum-limited Josephson parametric amplifier as the first-stage amplifier, 
%the replacement of the existing dilution refrigerator with a new one that has 
%a magnetic field of about 9~Tesla and a larger bore size, and the development 
%of a new cavity with a significantly larger effective volume. 
%With the improvements of the experimental setup and several years of data 
%taking, TASEH is expected to probe the QCD axion band in the target mass range.
